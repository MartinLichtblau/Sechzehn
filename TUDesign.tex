\chapter{Motivation}\label{ch:motivation}
% ! max. 1 page !
With the backing of its helpful and positive community, Sechzehn guides you through venues all around the world. 
Places like restaurants and museums are collectively rated. Each and every user of Sechzehn has the ability to share his personal experiences with the whole community. 
Our rating not only includes a textual rating system, it also allows the user to upload photos taken at this place. Furthermore we also offer a short like and dislike rating. \\\\
Sechzehn also has a social component. You see other members of our community on a map. This map combined with our real-time chat paves the way to quickly establish new and longlasting friendships.
Our real-time chats focuses on the most important features a messenger should have. This includes read receipts and the transmission of emojis. We do not distract you with features no one needs like photo filters and drawing capabilities in the chat. With our app maintaining friendships is also easier than ever: Friends are specially highlighted on the map. \\\\% TODO mehr
To satisfy more privacy-aware users who might not be happy with frequent position updates, we also provide an incongnito mode. If the user enters it, he is not displayed on the map of other users. 
This feature makes it possible to use our app if the user is somewhere he is not expected be. \\\\
An intuitive and enjoyable user experience is important for us. That's why we designed our app following the material design guidelines.

\chapter{Overview}\label{ch:overview}
% ! image demanded !
In this section we present the architecture we used and thereby how our components interact with each other. We then briefly describe which technologies we chose, and why we chose them.
\section{Architecture}\label{sec:architecture}
% components and their interaction
\subsection{Interaction of Components}
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./res/architecture.png}
	\caption{Architecture}
	\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}
The communication between the clients and our server is illustrated in \autoref{fig:architecture}.
For their communication with our server, the clients access the RESTful endpoints or use WebSocket connections. The latter one is necessary to provide our real-time chat. Since we do not have a huge community that backs our app, we need to retrieve the data from other sources. Our server therefore connects to the Foursquare API and fetches the venues, venue details and photos dynamically.
\clearpage
\subsection{Server API Documentation}
To connect app and server, the app developers need the knowledge of endpoints, query parameters and the data structures of requests and responses. To prevent that they need to look through the server's code, an extensive documentation is provided using Apiary \cite{apiary}. An impression is given in \autoref{fig:apiary}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./res/apiary.png}
	\caption{Screenshot of the Apiary Documentation}
	\label{fig:apiary}
\end{figure}

\clearpage
\subsection{Database}
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./res/sechzehn-erm.pdf}
	\caption{Database scheme}
	\label{fig:database_scheme}
\end{figure}

\section{Server}\label{sec:server}
To host our server we use the Heroku Cloud Application Platform\cite{heroku}. Heroku provides us a PostgreSQL\cite{postgresql} database service and an Node.js execution environment. Furthermore it offers access to Cloudinary\cite{cloudinary} image storage service that can be used as plugin within heroku. Heroku offers a free plan ``hobby-dev'' that we use.

\subsection{Node.js}

Node.js \cite{Node.js} is a cross-platform environment that allows building web servers with JavaScript.
This is contrary to the usual applications that are written in JavaScript since it was firstly designed to be a client-side scripting language for browsers. Node.js in its current version also supports asynchronous execution and concepts like generator functions. This allows easy-readable code on a high abstraction level with high-order functions and a good handling of asynchronous operations.

\subsection{AdonisJs}\label{sec:adonisjs}
AdonisJs \cite{adonisjs} is a MVC framework for Node.js web applications. It offers a further layer of abstraction and handles HTTP routing, requests and responses, content negotitation and an object-relational mapping to persist and fetch models from the database. In addition, it provides APIs for user input validation and sanitization, mail sending with templates, omitting fields from JSON output and authentication middleware. Due to this abstration, it is not necessary to deal with unpretentious programming work that has been done mutliple times before and is always the same for web application (e.g. routing, templating, authentication). 

\subsection{PostgreSQL}
PostgreSQL\cite{postgresql} is a powerful open-source relational database management system. It provides the ability to add useful extensions, new data types and functions. We use extensions to determine if a venue or another user is near to the user's current position and to compute a similarity metric on two strings. The latter is the basis of the venue and user search. PostgreSQL offers data types for time ranges that allow to search for open venues. In this context, a custom function is used to convert opening hours into an unambigous database represenation that prevent operlaps. Fortunately, heroku provides a PostgreSQL plugin.

\subsection{JSON Web Tokens}\label{sec:json_web_tokens}
The authentication in our project is done with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)\cite{jwt}. Given a secure connection, JWTs offer a secure, stateless authentication methods that renders sessions and cookies unnecessary.

\section{Client}\label{sec:client}
\subsection{Android Data Binding}
\cite{databinding}
\subsection{Retrofit}
In our app HTTP requests are done with Retrofit\cite{retrofit}. Retrofit is a type-safe client for Android that helps the developer to retrieve and upload structured data like JSON via a REST based webservice. Retrofit itself is based on the OkHttp Library. We chose to use Retrofit because it is a state-of-the-art technology that is also recommended by the Google Guidelines.
\subsection{GSON}
GSON\cite{gson} is a Java library that offers a simple way to serialize and deserialize JSON Objects to Java Objects and the other way around. One of the reason why we chose it, that it does not require additional class anotations like alternative libraries do. GSON is well documented and developed (and recommended) by Google.
\subsection{ChatKit}
ChatKit for Android \cite{chatkit} is a library that is designed to simplify the UI development of websocket based chats in Android. It offers predefined components like Dialog Lists, Message Lists, and Message Input. Furthermore it provides state-of-the-art messaging features like read receipts without too much additional effort.

\chapter{App and Feature Explanation}\label{ch:app_and_feature_explanation}

\section{System Requirements}\label{sec:system_requirements}
%minSDK 23 %% compileSDK 25 ??? %% Permissions and justification why they are necessary
To run the app with all features Android Marshmallow (APK 23) is needed. 
In this section we briefly describe which permissions are requested by the app and why they are necessary.
\begin{enumerate}
\item permission to take pictures and videos: This permission allows us to take pictures and add them to venues.
\item permission to get access to pictures, media, and files on the device: Normally users use profile pictures for more than one app, what makes it necessary to load those pictures from the gallery. This permission is further needed to store the users login credentials on the phone.
\item permission to have access to the location of the device: The whole concept of the app is based on the users location. The location is necessary to see users and venues in the surroundings. With an incognito switch however, the user can hide his account from the map.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Get Started}
%%%download and install the APK%%%
To install the app you have to download it from the app from our web page \cite{app}. After you downloaded it you have to install it. If your phone has not the permission to install apps from third parties, you have to allow your phone to install apps from third parties. This is described by the following steps (some phones will directly lead you to step 3):
\begin{enumerate}
\item go to Settings
\item choose Security
\item scroll to Unknown sources
\item allow the installation from unknown sources
\end{enumerate} 
If your phone is allowed to install apps from third parties, the phone asks you to install the app. To do so tap on install. Now you have installed the app successfully. Have fun and enjoy the usage.

\section{Features}
We only list the bonus features because the mandatory features have to be fullfilled.
\begin{enumerate}
\item account verification with an email: \\
After registering the email has to be verified first. Without this verification, the user cannot use the app.
\item open the links from the emails: \\
After resetting your password or registering a new account the user receives an email containing a link. Our app is able to handle this link on click. This means that no verification code must be entered and no external browser is necessary to do this.
\item Resource-efficient location updating: \\
To treat the users battery with care, we use the Google Location Services. If another app on the system requests the location via those location services, we use the new location if it is more accurate. If there hasn't been a request for more than two minutes our app self starts a request to the location services. More inaccurate locations are used after ten minutes without an more accurate position. Furthermore we only push our new location to the Sechzehn servers, when the user moved more than 100 meters. 
\item Incognito-Mode: \\
Within his settings the user can disable that other users of Sechzehn can see his position. This feature allows privacy without logging out.
\item Live Chats: \\
Our app not only gives you the opportunity to see friends on a map, you can also contact them via live chats. Those live chats also support read receipts.
\item Venue Filters: \\
The venue search offers filtering for opening hours and price category.
\item JWT
\item Caching
\end{enumerate}

When a user starts the app for the first time he enters the login screen. On this screen the user has three options:
\begin{enumerate}
\item he can log in with his email and password. If the login was successful the app asks for some permissions (further information on why the app needs those permissions can be found in \ref{sec:system_requirements}.
If the permissions are granted, the main screen is shown. The login information will be stored so that the user doesn't need to log in every time he uses the app. If he wants to log out he can do it in the options.
\item if he has no account yet, he can enter the register screen.
\item if he has forgotten his password he can request a password reset link to his email address.
\end{enumerate}
%%%REGISTRATION SCREEN%%%
If he enters the register screen he has two options:   
\begin{enumerate}
\item he can enter a username, an email address, and a password (two times). By clicking the register button the inputs are checked If the passwords are equal, the email address and the username are not used yet a toast tell that the registration was successful. Otherwise, there will be an information why the registration failed (username already exists, passwords are not equal, ...) and he has to correct it. After a successful registration, the screen switches to the login screen and an email confirmation is sent. To confirm the account a the link in the email has to be clicked. The smartphone offers the possibility to open the link via a browser or the app 'Sechzehn'. If the link is opened with 'Sechzehn' the account will be activated and the login screen is shown.  
\item if he has already an account, he can go back to the login screen.
\end{enumerate}
%%%FORGOTPW SCREEN%%%
If he enters the forgot password screen he has two options:
\begin{enumerate}
\item he can enter the email address and click the send button. A password reset request will be sent to that email address. The link in the email could be opened with 'Sechzehn' or with any browser. If the link in the email is opened with 'Sechzehn' a screen is opened where you have to insert a new password (two times). By clicking the confirm button the passwords are checked and if they are equal the new password is set. The same procedure could be done on a website by opening the link 
\item if he knows the password he can go back to the login screen.
\end{enumerate}
%%%MAIN SCREEN%%%
We further assume that the user is logged in. Now he sees a bottom navigation bar with three navigation options:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the first one shows the map with venues and users and offers a search for venues
\item the second one shows a list with friends and messages
\item the third one is the user's profile and its settings. Here you can select a profile picture from your gallery by tapping on the photo. To edit the name, birthday, city or to enter the incognito mode, you have to tap on the pencil in the profile section. In the account section, you can log out from the app, change the current password, reset the password if you are logged in and don't know your password, change the used email address, and delete your account.
